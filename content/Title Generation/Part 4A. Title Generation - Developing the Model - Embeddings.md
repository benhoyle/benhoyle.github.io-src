# 4A. Title Generation - Developing the Model - Embeddings

This post looks at developing our initial models to include state of the art features to improve results.

To recap:

* We have two models: the Ludwig model and the Chollet/Brownlee model. 
* Performance so far has been fairly poor.
* Each model had slightly different characteristics - the Ludwig model produced better formed output but seemed to simply memorise and repeat titles, the Chollet/Brownlee model had a lower loss and appeared to memorise less but produced more nonsensical outputs.

In our last post we identified a number of ways to improve our models:

1. Use GloVe encodings and a shared embedding layer. 
2. Add attention.
3. Add pointers / skip connections between our input and our output.
4. Use a coverage measure.
5. Use different word forms such as lemmas or stems.
6. Use a GAN-style discriminator on the output.
7. Improve our sampling by employing beam search.

Over the next set of posts, we will look at the first two of these in detail. This post starts with using pre-trained embedding weights and an embedding layer that is shared across the encoder and decoder input.


```python
# Imports 
import numpy as np
import os
```

## Using Pre-trained Shared Embeddings 

Here we will look at two complementary modifications to our model:

* We can speed-up our training by using a set of pre-trained embedding weights; and
* As the encoder and decoder both take words with a similar vocabulary as input, we can share a single set of weights between the encoder and decoder.

### Pre-trained Embedding Weights

There are several different ways to generate and use a set of pre-trained word embeddings. Two very common approaches are to use either pretrained [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) or [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) embeddings. Anecdotally, for small toy projects, both have similar characteristics. The GloVe vectors are the easiest to download and use, so we'll start with those.  

As a start, I recommend using the 100 dimension vectors generated from a crawl of 6 billion words. This can be downloaded as a text file from [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip). This is to be placed in a `/glove` directory.

Then we follow the steps from Ludwig's example to generate our embedding matrix. 

The code below reads the entries in the text file and generates a dictionary indexed by a word with a numpy array containing the embedding vector as an entry.


```python
GLOVE_DIR = "glove/"

embeddings_index = {}
# For Python 3 tweaked to add 'rb'
f = open(os.path.join(GLOVE_DIR, 'glove.6B.100d.txt'), 'rb')
for line in f:
    values = line.split()
    # Tweaked to decode the binary text values
    word = values[0].decode('utf-8')
    coefs = np.asarray(values[1:], dtype='float32')
    embeddings_index[word] = coefs
f.close()
```


```python
len(embeddings_index)
```




    400000




```python
list(embeddings_index.keys())[0:10]
```




    ['irati',
     'fotiou',
     '8-year',
     'usagi',
     'autobianchi',
     'eldercare',
     'puraskar',
     'dench',
     'ventrally',
     'amsc']



As we can see there are 400,000 words. Some of which are fairly arcane (note "eldercare", which is a US-centric term). Below is the 100d word embedding vector for "the".


```python
embeddings_index.get('the')
```

### Loading and Tokenizing Data

Initially we load our data as before. Our tokenizing routine changes a little, as we will use a common tokenizer on both the claim text and title. This allows us to use a shared embedding layer.


```python
# Set parameters
num_decoder_tokens = 2500 # This is our output title vocabulary
num_encoder_tokens = 2500 # This is our input claim vocabulary
encoder_seq_length = 300 # This is our limit for our input claim length
decoder_seq_length = 22 # This is our limit for our output title length - 20 + 2 for start/stop
```


```python
import pickle
import os

PIK = "claim_and_title.data"

if not os.path.isfile(PIK):
    # Download file
    !wget https://benhoyle.github.io/notebooks/title_generation/claim_and_title.data

with open(PIK, "rb") as f:
    print("Loading data")
    data = pickle.load(f)
    print("{0} samples loaded".format(len(data)))
    
print("\n\nAdding start and stop tokens to output")
data = [(c, "startseq {0} stopseq".format(t)) for c, t in data]
                                      
print("\n\nAn example title:", data[0][1])
print("----")
print("An example claim:", data[0][0])
```

    An example claim: 
    1. A method for managing a backup service gateway (SGW) associated with a primary SGW, the method comprising:
    periodically receiving from the primary SGW at least a portion of corresponding UE session state information, the received portion of session state information being sufficient to enable the backup SGW to indicate to an inquiring management entity that UEs having an active session supported by the primary SGW are in a live state; and
    in response to a failure of the primary SGW, the backup SGW assuming management of IP addresses and paths associated with said primary SGW and transmitting a Downlink Data Notification (DDN) toward a Mobility Management Entity (MME) for each of said UEs having an active session supported by the failed primary SGW to detach from the network and reattach to the network, wherein each DDN causes the MME to send a detach request with a reattach request code to the respective UE.
    
    



```python
from keras.preprocessing import text
t_joint = text.Tokenizer(
                num_words=num_encoder_tokens, 
                lower=True,
                char_level=False,
                oov_token="<UNK>"
)
X_texts = [d[0] for d in data]
Y_texts = [d[1] for d in data]
total_texts = X_texts + Y_texts
t_joint.fit_on_texts(total_texts)
```

    /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/h5py/__init__.py:36: FutureWarning: Conversion of the second argument of issubdtype from `float` to `np.floating` is deprecated. In future, it will be treated as `np.float64 == np.dtype(float).type`.
      from ._conv import register_converters as _register_converters
    Using TensorFlow backend.



```python
list(t_joint.word_index.keys())[0:10]
```




    ['remapper',
     'inactive',
     'imposes',
     'overestimates',
     'roman',
     'mitigating',
     "location's",
     '56a',
     'buckle',
     'billable']




```python
X_seqs = t_joint.texts_to_sequences(X_texts)
Y_seqs = t_joint.texts_to_sequences(Y_texts)
print("Our input sequences (claims) have a max integer value of {0}".format(max([max(x) for x in X_seqs])))
print("Our output sequences (titles) have a max integer value of {0}".format(max([max(y) for y in Y_seqs])))
```

    Our input sequences (claims) have a max integer value of 2499
    Our output sequences (titles) have a vocabulary of 2499 words



```python
vocab_size = max([max(x + y) for x, y in zip(X_seqs, Y_seqs)]) + 1
vocab_size
```




    2500




```python
filtered_seqs = [(x, y) for x,y in zip(X_seqs, Y_seqs) if len(x) <= encoder_seq_length and len(y) <= decoder_seq_length]
X_seqs = [x for x, _ in filtered_seqs]
Y_seqs = [y for _, y in filtered_seqs]

X_length = [len(x) for x in X_seqs]
max_length = max(X_length)
print("Our longest input sequence is {0} tokens long.".format(max_length))

Y_length = [len(y) for y in Y_seqs]
max_length = max(Y_length)
print("Our longest output sequence is {0} tokens long.".format(max_length))
```

    Our longest input sequence is 300 tokens long.
    Our longest output sequence is 22 tokens long.


### Building the Word Embedding Matrix

Now we have a dictionary of numpy arrays indexed by word strings and a dictionary of ranked words from the Keras tokenizer we can build the matrix to use as the initial weights for our shared embedding layer.

We need to filter the tokenizer dictionary to remove all words that are ranked less than our number of alloted tokens for the encoder and decoder inputs (e.g. all with ranks less than the vocabulary size of 2500).

We then iterate through our words from the tokenizer dictionary and link the word index integers with the embedding vectors.


```python
word_embedding_size = 100 # As we are using the Glove 100d data
print('Found {0} word vectors.'.format(len(embeddings_index)))
embedding_matrix = np.zeros((vocab_size, word_embedding_size))

# Filter our vocab to only the used items
words = [(w, i) for w, i in t_joint.word_index.items() if int(i) < vocab_size]

# This is from https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-word-embedding-layers-deep-learning-keras/      
for word, i in words:
    embedding_vector = embeddings_index.get(word)
    if embedding_vector is not None:
        embedding_matrix[i] = embedding_vector
```

    Found 400000 word vectors.


The resultant matrix should be of shape : vocabulary size by GloVe dimensions = 2500 x 100.


```python
embedding_matrix.shape
```




    (2500, 100)



### Finish Preparing Data

Now we just finish preparing the data by padding as before.


```python
print(X_texts[0], X_seqs[0])
print(Y_texts[0], Y_seqs[0])
```

    
    1. A method for managing a backup service gateway (SGW) associated with a primary SGW, the method comprising:

    in response to a failure of the primary SGW, the backup SGW assuming management of IP addresses and paths associated with said primary SGW and transmitting a Downlink Data Notification (DDN) toward a Mobility Management Entity (MME) for each of said UEs having an active session supported by the failed primary SGW to detach from the network and reattach to the network, wherein each DDN causes the MME to send a detach request with a reattach request code to the respective UE.

    startseq System and method for session restoration at geo-redundant gateways stopseq [34, 30, 5, 29, 8, 352, 14, 1836, 35]



```python
# Pad the data
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

X = pad_sequences(X_seqs, maxlen=encoder_seq_length)
Y = pad_sequences(Y_seqs, maxlen=decoder_seq_length, padding='post')

print("Our X data has shape {0} and our Y data has shape {1}".format(X.shape, Y.shape))
```

    Our X data has shape (25632, 300) and our Y data has shape (25632, 22)



```python
Y[0]
```

## Adapting the Ludwig Model

We will now adapt the Ludwig model used in the previous post to use a shared embedding layer and the pre-trained GloVe vectors.

This is fairly simple - we just define an embedding layer and initialise it with the generated embedding matrix. We then specify that it is to be used on both the encoder and decoder inputs.


```python
# imports
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, Embedding
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

%matplotlib inline
from keras.layers import concatenate

y_vocab_len = num_decoder_tokens # This is our output title vocabulary
X_vocab_len = num_encoder_tokens # This is our input claim vocabulary
X_max_len = encoder_seq_length # This is our limit for our input claim length
y_max_len = decoder_seq_length # This is our limit for our output title length - 20 + 2 for start/stop

# source text input model
inputs1 = Input(shape=(X_max_len,))
#am1 = Embedding(X_vocab_len, 128)(inputs1)
Shared_Embedding = Embedding(
    output_dim=word_embedding_size, 
    input_dim=vocab_size, 
    weights=[embedding_matrix]
)
am1 = Shared_Embedding(inputs1)
am2 = LSTM(128)(am1)
# summary input model
inputs2 = Input(shape=(y_max_len,))
sm1 = Shared_Embedding(inputs2)
sm2 = LSTM(128)(sm1)
# decoder output model
decoder1 = concatenate([am2, sm2])
outputs = Dense(y_vocab_len, activation='softmax')(decoder1)
# tie it together [article, summary] [word]
model = Model(inputs=[inputs1, inputs2], outputs=outputs)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
```


```python
model.summary()
```

Now we see that the embedding is shared by both LSTMs. 

We can now build our model in pretty much the same way as before...


```python
# We need to split into train and test data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# seed for reproducing same results
seed = 9
np.random.seed(seed)

# split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%)
(X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test) = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=seed)
```


```python
Y[0]
```




    array([  34,   30,    5,   29,    8,  352,   14, 1836,   35,    0,    0,
              0,    0,    0,    0,    0,    0,    0,    0,    0,    0,    0],
          dtype=int32)



One small bug we had to fix is that we can now no longer hard-code the integer indexes for our start and stop control tokens. We thus use the word_index dictionary to look up the integer based on the text.


```python
def generate_set(X, Y, i_end, i):
    """ Generate the data for training/validation from X and Y.
    i_end is the end of the set, i is the start."""
    set_size = 0
    limit_list = list()
    for sent in Y[i:i_end]:
        # Edited below to use integer value of EOS symbol
        limit = np.where(sent==t_joint.word_index["stopseq"])[0][0]  #  the position of the symbol EOS
        set_size += limit + 1
        limit_list.append(limit)
   
    # We need to change this bit to set our array size based on the limit values
    # Generate blank arrays for the set
    I_1 = np.zeros((set_size, X_max_len))
    I_2 = np.zeros((set_size, y_max_len))
    # This below is a big array
    Y_set = np.zeros((set_size, y_vocab_len))
    count = 0
    # Now we want to create, for each sample, a set of examples for each word in the title
    # Have we just been training on 0 to 100?!?!
    for l in range(0, (i_end - i)):
        # for each X and y in set of NB_SET 
            
        # We need to build the input for the second encoder for the next word in y
        # I.e. for word 3 in the title the input2 consists of words 1 and 2 (using teacher forcing)
            
        # Get length of current title - i.e. where the integer = 2 = stopseq
        limit = limit_list[l]
            
        # We only need to create examples up to the length of the title 
        for m in range(1, limit+1):
                
            # Generate our one-hot y out
            one_hot_out = np.zeros((1, y_vocab_len))
            # This builds our one-hot generation into our training loop
            # The l and m respectively iterate through the samples and the output sequence elements
            one_hot_out[0, Y[l+i][m]] = 1
                
            # Create a blank row/array for a partial input for our summary model - this is fed into the decoder
            # It is of the same size as our title

So using the shared embedding appears to provide a small advantage in reducing our loss function. It also lowers the number of parameters for our model, which is a good thing as it reduces over-fitting and training time.


```python
# summarize history for accuracy
plt.plot(train_loss)
plt.plot(val_loss)
plt.title('Model Loss')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.xlabel('Iteration')
plt.legend(['train', 'test'], loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

Now we've trained our model we need some code to test it. Again, this is pretty much as before but with some tweaks to use the word_index dictionaries to look up our control characters.


```python
# Set up dictionary to translate indices to words
y_dictionary = dict(
            (i, char) for char, i in t_joint.word_index.items()
        )

x_dictionary = dict(
            (i, char) for char, i in t_joint.word_index.items()
        )

def seq2text(seq, dictionary):
    text = ''
    for k in seq:
        k = k.astype(int)
        # Adapted to take account of different control integers
        if k not in [t_joint.word_index["stopseq"], t_joint.word_index["startseq"], 0] and k < (len(dictionary)-1):
            w = dictionary[k]
            text = text + w + ' '
    return text

def greedy_decoder(X_seq):
    # reformat input seq
    input_seq = np.zeros((1, X_max_len))
    input_seq[0, :] = X_seq
    flag = 0
    prob = 1
    ans_partial = np.zeros((1, y_max_len))
    # Add start token integer to end of ans_partial input - initially [0,0,...BOS]
    ans_partial[0, -1] = t_joint.word_index["startseq"]  #  the index of the symbol BOS (begin of sentence)
    for k in range(y_max_len - 1):
        ye = model.predict([input_seq, ans_partial])
        yel = ye[0,:]
        p = np.max(yel)
        mp = np.argmax(ye)
        # It is this line that sets how our training data should be arranged - need to change both
        # the line below shifts the existing ans_partial by 1 to the left - [0, 0, ..., BOS, 0]
        ans_partial[0, 0:-1] = ans_partial[0, 1:]
        # This then adds the newly decoded word onto the end of ans_partial
        ans_partial[0, -1] = mp
        if mp == t_joint.word_index["stopseq"]:  #  the index of the symbol EOS (end of sentence)
            flag = 1
        if flag == 0:    
            prob = prob * p
    text = seq2text(ans_partial[0], y_dictionary)
    return(text, prob)

num_test_titles = len(X_test)
indices = np.arange(num_test_titles)
np.random.shuffle(indices)
X_test = X_test[indices]
Y_test = Y_test[indices]
for i in range(0, 5):
    text, prob = greedy_decoder(X_test[i])
    Y_test_text = seq2text(Y_test[i], y_dictionary)
    claim_text = seq2text(X_test[i], x_dictionary)

#### Comments on Results

From this training there now appears more of a link between the claim text and the predicted title. The model seems to be learning a few patterns such as - "method and system for creating a [] method and system method". 

This result seems close:
```
    Sample of claim text: 1 an apparatus comprising a capacitive sense array and a processing device wherein the capacitive sense array is configured to detect a presence of a touch object or a stylus wherein the capacitive se
    
    Predicted title is: method and apparatus for displaying a touch screen method and apparatus for the same  (with prob 1.9565373226245597e-05). 
    Test title is: capacitive sense array for detecting touch objects and an active stylus  
```
 
Training still appears unstable. Some of this may be due to the shuffling for regularisation.
 
The results appear an improvement though on the previous model. It is worth keeping this feature.

#### Options for Further Investigation

It may be worth experimenting with different training parameters and not shuffling the data. Lowering the batch size might reduce some of the loss variance.


Also adding some regularisation may help prevent overfitting. Maybe by adding some dropout (0.2?) to the LSTMs and by adding an L2 regulariser to the dense layer.

Again this seems to offer an improvement by lowering our loss.


```python
# summarize history for accuracy
plt.plot(train_loss)
plt.plot(val_loss)
plt.title('Model Loss')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.xlabel('Iteration')
plt.legend(['train', 'test'], loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```

Our training and model loss end up lower and are slowly decreasing. This again suggests that the shared embedding is an improvement. We still look to plateau on our training data after 40-50 iterations (~9 or 10 epochs). From about 40 iterations we start overfitting on our training data.


```python
def sample(preds, temperature=1.0):
    # helper function to sample an index from a probability array
    preds = np.asarray(preds).astype('float64')
    preds = np.log(preds) / temperature
    exp_preds = np.exp(preds)
    preds = exp_preds / np.sum(exp_preds)
    probas = np.random.multinomial(1, preds, 1)
    return np.argmax(probas)
```

Again we adapt this to use the word_index entries.


```python
def predict_sequence(infenc, infdec, source, decoder_seq_length, temp=1.0):
    # encode
    state = infenc.predict(source)
    # start of sequence input
    target_seq = array([t_joint.word_index["startseq"]])
    # collect predictions
    output = list()
    for t in range(decoder_seq_length):
        # predict next char
        yhat, h, c = infdec.predict([target_seq] + state)
        # update state
        state = [h, c]
        # update target sequence - this needs to be the argmax
        next_int = sample(yhat[0, 0, :], temp)
        output.append(next_int)
        # It seems like we throw a lot of information away here - can we build in the probabilities?
        target_seq = array([next_int])
        # Check for stopping character
        if next_int == t_joint.word_index["stopseq"]:
            break
    return output
```


```python
# Testing
num_test_titles = len(X_test)
indices = np.arange(num_test_titles)
np.random.shuffle(indices)
X_test = X_test[indices]
Y_test = Y_test[indices]
for i in range(0, 5):
    pred_seq = predict_sequence(infenc, infdec, X_test[i], decoder_seq_length, temp=0.8)
    predicted_text = seq2text(pred_seq, y_dictionary)
    Y_test_text = seq2text(Y_test[i], y_dictionary)
    claim_text = seq2text(X_test[i], x_dictionary)
    print("Sample of claim text: {}\n".format(claim_text[0:200]))
    print("Predicted title is: {}. \n Test title is: {} \n---\n".format(predicted_text, Y_test_text))
```

These titles still appear worse than those produced with the Ludwig model, despite a lower loss. The model almost appears to be guessing random words. This may be due to how the decoder is trained.

## Summary

Here we have looked at applying pre-trained word embeddings, and a shared embedding layer, to our sequence to sequence models.

This approach appears to very slightly improve our models. At the very least, it does not appear to worsen the models and provides a useful simplification. Hence, it appears to be a useful addition to our models.

### Making Things Easier

As we saw in this post, we are now reusing much of our previous code. To simplify our notebooks it would now be a good idea to abstract over some of the functionality. To do this we can create Python objects (classes) that have a common interface for both models, and that maximise reuse of common routines where possible.

To this end we can create four classes:

* An abstract class that defines the common interfaces. This is found in the file [here]({filename}/notebooks/title_generation/abstract_model_wrapper.py).
* A derived abstract class that defines common sequence-to-sequence model functions. This is found in the file [here]({filename}/notebooks/title_generation/base_seq2seq.py).
* A concrete class for the Ludwig model with shared embeddings. This differs from the above class through the use of a custom `_build_model()` function. This is found in the file [here]({filename}/notebooks/title_generation/ludwig_model.py).
* A concrete class for the Chollet/Brownlee model with shared embeddings. This also differs from the derived abstract class through the use of a custom `_build_model()` function. This is found in the file [here]({filename}/notebooks/title_generation/cb_model.py).

We can then concentrate on over-riding the model building part of the class while leaving all other functions the same.
