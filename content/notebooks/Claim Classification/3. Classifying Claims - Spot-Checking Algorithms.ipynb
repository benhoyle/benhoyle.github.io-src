    "\n",
    "Our baseline - making a random choice based on the different proportions of labels available is around 20% accuracy, i.e. if we guess randomly we still correctly classify the claims 1 time out of 5.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The k-Nearest Neighbours classifier does quite poorly. This indicates that clear groups within the TD-IDF vector space do not exist. The AdaBoost classifier has a comparative performance at around 35% accuracy. It would thus seem sensible to exclude these classifiers at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree-based classifiers - Decision Trees and Random Forest Classifiers - do a little better with around 50% accuracy. Random Forests appear to provide a small improvement (~ 3%) over Decision Trees. However, these are around 10% below the next set of classifiers, so again we will exclude these classifiers at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves four classifiers with accuracies of around 60%: Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB), a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDClassifier), an SVM with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel (SVC) and an Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPClassifier). By comparing the linear SVM and MLP we can see that adding hidden layers to a linear model provides an improvement of around 4%. Also the SVC classifier scores highly, better than the linear SVM. It thus seems sensible to look at neural networks with hidden layers over linear regression models. The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier works surprisingly well, and slightly out-peforms the linear SVM. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these results it looks like deep-learning, i.e. multilayer neural networks could provide a good result. We will thus investigate these methods in more detail in the next post. It would also be worth varying some parameters of the SVC classifier to see if we can improve accuracy (although training time may be an issue).\n",
    "\n",
    "As Bayesian methods come at things from a quite different perspective, it may also be worth investigating whether we can obtain any improvement over the Naive Bayes approach.  "
