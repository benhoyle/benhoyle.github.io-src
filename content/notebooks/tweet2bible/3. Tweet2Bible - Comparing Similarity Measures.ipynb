    "* [Difflib's SequenceMatcher](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html) has a \"ratio\" function that provides a match score for two strings. This represents a \"naive\" baseline.\n",
    "* We can use spaCy's [\"similarity\" method](https://spacy.io/usage/vectors-similarity) on \"doc\" objects (i.e. as applied to each string).\n",
    "* We can apply the techniques set available in Gensim as set out in [this helpful tutorial](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/tut3.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use the results as a baseline for more complex models and algorithms.\n",
