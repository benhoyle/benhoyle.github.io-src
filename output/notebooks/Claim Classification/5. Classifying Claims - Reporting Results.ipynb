    "1. Context - Define and describe why we are undertaking the project;\n",

    "3. Solution - Describe the solution our results suggest;\n",

    "\n",
    "As described in our first post, the project was undertaken to practice applying a methodical approach to real-world patent data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the world of patent law, we have sets of patent claims, which set out the scope of legal protection. These claims, as they are contained in a patent application, are assigned a patent classification, which is a hierarchical code that categorises the subject-matter of the claims. \n",
    "\n",
    "Patent specifications are published and made available for download in bulk. This provides large labelled datasets we can use to practice supervised machine learning. In particular, we can extract a main independent claim and an International Patent Classification (IPC) code as data for machine learning algorithms. To simplify things, we can start with the first letter of the IPC code, which assigns each patent application to one of eight classes."

    "Our results indicate that a multi-layer perceptron or a Naive Bayes classifier would be the best at performing this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, from our results it does not seem possible to implement an accurate classifier for this problem. The best solutions return an accuracy of around 60%. While better than chance given the proportions of the data (~20%) this is still not necessarily high enough to confidently apply a classifier in a processing pipeline, e.g. to differentially process the text of the patent claim. \n",

    "It would, though, appear possible to provide probabilities for classes that could support human decision making.   "
