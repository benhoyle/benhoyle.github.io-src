# 4C. Title Generation - Developing the Model - Beam Search

This post looks at developing our initial models to include state of the art features to improve results.

To recap:

* We have two models: the Ludwig model and the Chollet/Brownlee model. 
* Performance so far has been fairly poor.
* Each model had slightly different characteristics - the Ludwig model produced better formed output but seemed to simply memorise and repeat titles, the Chollet/Brownlee model had a lower loss and appeared to memorise less but produced more nonsensical outputs.

In this post we will look at implementing a beam search decoder as an improvement to our previous greedy decoder.

### Beam Search Decoding

This [video from the Udacity Deep Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW6Cs82UKo) provides a good explanation of beam search.

Basically, when you generate a sequence on a token-by-token basis, each token has an associated probability, where the decoder outputs a vector indicative of probabilities for all possible tokens (in our model at least). 

A naive way to select the tokens for the sequence is just to select the largest probability at each step in the sequence. Many decoder structures that are described on the Internet do this. However, this can lead to problems: if you have several tokens with similar probabilities, you might select one token that actually leads to a less likely sequence overall.

To remedy this you might want to keep track of all possible output sequences. However, the number of possible sequences grows exponentially. (Even with a small vocabulary of 2500 tokens you can end up the same number of sequences as there are atoms in the universe!) Beam search makes this manageable by keeping track of only k top sequences. 

Machine Learning Mastery has an article [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/beam-search-decoder-natural-language-processing/) that describes how to implement a beam search in Python. However, in the comments this is criticised for being too simplistic. On review, I think this criticism is warranted: the function does not look at different, branching trees of tokens; instead, the probabilities are "given" in a pre-generated array.

Here is [another example](https://gist.github.com/udibr/67be473cf053d8c38730) of a beam search for keras and here is an [example slide] (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/46927-f97/slides/Lec3/sld023.htm) showing the branching trees.

To implement, the beam search algorithm, we need a function that performs the following steps:

* Initialise probabilities to 1 for start token;
* Predict the list of probabilities for the start token;
* Update scores as score * -log(list of probs);
* Select the k top scores;
* Build k sequences for each of the k top probabilities  = start token + prediction for 0 to k-1; and
* Iterate by predicting the next token for each sequence and updating the scores and sequences.

We can also amend our methods for printing examples to print the top k sequences and their probabilities.

With reference to our models, we can implement beam search as a custom `_predict_from_seq()` method.

We need a data structure to store, for our k top sequences:
* scores;
* token sequences.

Our input will be:
* claim text (as for our previous decoder); and
* a value for k, the number of sequences to track.

We want to output:
* the k sequences with top scores, where sequences stop when the stop token is predicted or when the maximum number of output tokens is reached.

## Ludwig Model - Custom Decoding Function

Let's start by working on our custom decoding function. This will have the form of `_predict_from_seq()` as previously developed.

We can first try this out and debug as a separate method that takes a pre-existing model object as self. Once we get something working we can then easily create a custom class that inherits from a previous object definition that has the custom beam search decoding method.

## Comments

Using the beam search decoder has two advantages:
- it improves the quality of our predicted titles: the highest scoring titles in these examples appear to reflect fairly accurately the most relevant titles; and
- it allows us to visualise how our models are working by outputing the k highest scoring entries.

The downside is that decoding time is increased. But this doesn't matter that much for our toy project.

It seems worthwhile folding beam search into our models. One option is to maybe create a mix-in class to add the beam search functionality.
