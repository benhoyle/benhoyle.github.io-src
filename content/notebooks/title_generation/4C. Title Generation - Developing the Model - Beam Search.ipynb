    "### Beam Search Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "This [video from the Udacity Deep Learning Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW6Cs82UKo) provides a good explanation of beam search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, when you generate a sequence on a token-by-token basis, each token has an associated probability, where the decoder outputs a vector indicative of probabilities for all possible tokens (in our model at least). \n",
    "\n",
    "A naive way to select the tokens for the sequence is just to select the largest probability at each step in the sequence. Many decoder structures that are described on the Internet do this. However, this can lead to problems: if you have several tokens with similar probabilities, you might select one token that actually leads to a less likely sequence overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remedy this you might want to keep track of all possible output sequences. However, the number of possible sequences grows exponentially. (Even with a small vocabulary of 2500 tokens you can end up the same number of sequences as there are atoms in the universe!) Beam search makes this manageable by keeping track of only k top sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning Mastery has an article [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/beam-search-decoder-natural-language-processing/) that describes how to implement a beam search in Python. However, in the comments this is criticised for being too simplistic. On review, I think this criticism is warranted: the function does not look at different, branching trees of tokens; instead, the probabilities are \"given\" in a pre-generated array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is [another example](https://gist.github.com/udibr/67be473cf053d8c38730) of a beam search for keras and here is an [example slide] (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/46927-f97/slides/Lec3/sld023.htm) showing the branching trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement, the beam search algorithm, we need a function that performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialise probabilities to 1 for start token;\n",
    "* Predict the list of probabilities for the start token;\n",
    "* Update scores as score * -log(list of probs);\n",
    "* Select the k top scores;\n",
    "* Build k sequences for each of the k top probabilities  = start token + prediction for 0 to k-1; and\n",
    "* Iterate by predicting the next token for each sequence and updating the scores and sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also amend our methods for printing examples to print the top k sequences and their probabilities."
