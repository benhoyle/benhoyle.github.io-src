# 2. Tweet2Bible - Exploring the Data

In the previous post we looked at the problem for our current project: how to match a tweet to passages of the Bible.

In this post we will look at the steps required to prepare some data for our algorithms. We will also look at the nature of the data, which may give us some insights as to how we transform our data in later stages.

## Getting the Data

### Tweets

Twitter offers an option in the settings to download your tweet archive. Log in to the web version, goto account settings and click the "Download Archive" button. You will then be sent an email with a link to the data.

Fair play to Twitter, the archive is quite cool. You get a CSV file with your tweets and some other useful data, plus a JSON archive (which can be viewed via a local HTML file). To keep things simple we'll just use the CSV file for now.


```python
import csv
with open('tweets.csv', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
    casereader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    data = [row for row in casereader]
```


```python
data[0]
```




    ['tweet_id',
     'in_reply_to_status_id',
     'in_reply_to_user_id',
     'timestamp',
     'source',
     'text',
     'retweeted_status_id',
     'retweeted_status_user_id',
     'retweeted_status_timestamp',
     'expanded_urls']




```python
data[1:3]
```




    [['1009719610910957568',
      '1009527946036613121',
      '20524211',
      '2018-06-21 08:48:09 +0000',
      '<a href="http://twitter.com" rel="nofollow">Twitter Web Client</a>',
      "@patently It's okay - whatever photo storage app you use is already plugged into the system.",
      '',
      '',
      '',
      ''],
     ['1009409717205168128',
      '',
      '',
      '2018-06-20 12:16:45 +0000',
      '<a href="http://twitter.com/download/iphone" rel="nofollow">Twitter for iPhone</a>',
      'I love all the people the computer said ‚Äúlooked a bit like Rick Astley‚Äù including, I think, JFK, Jesus and Norman Bates. https://t.co/HHI0HFU0Cy',
      '',
      '',
      '',
      'https://twitter.com/quasimondo/status/1009369380042485760']]



For now we will just extract the text to get a list of strings.


```python
D1 = [d[5] for d in data[1:]]
```


```python
D1[0:5]
```




    ["@patently It's okay - whatever photo storage app you use is already plugged into the system.",
     'I love all the people the computer said ‚Äúlooked a bit like Rick Astley‚Äù including, I think, JFK, Jesus and Norman Bates. https://t.co/HHI0HFU0Cy',
     "‚ÄúThese were ancient engineers with a genius that allowed people to walk multi-tonne statues and roll multi-tonne hats - which teaches us about the society's investment in honouring their ancestors. It's quite a remarkable accomplishment‚Äù https://t.co/DzscvwJ0do https://t.co/Q7B8ioRS0h",
     'KPMG audit work unacceptable - watchdog https://t.co/9np6lWkHTG [Average remuneration per partner in 2016 = ¬£582k]',
     'Ooo Le Sud by Nino Ferrer - well done @SpotifyUK algorithms https://t.co/ANxMxVWiJV [Question is do I prefer the original French or Nino‚Äôs English version? Also check out the brilliantly proggy M√©tronomie]']




```python
"We have {0} tweets.".format(len(D1))
```




    'We have 9806 tweets.'



Looking at some of our tweets, we need to unescape the text such that "&amp;" is converted to "&". This can be performed using the html library.


```python
import html

D1 = [html.unescape(t) for t in D1]
```

### Bible

The Bible is actually quite a good source of text for natural language processing projects. 

* it is free; 
* people want to make it easy to distribute; 
* it is naturally broken down into short passages; and
* it contains a variety of styles (I like to thing of it as a 2000 year old Wikipedia for middle-eastern farmers).

For this project I went to [BibleHub.net](http://biblehub.net/database/) which offers an Excel spreadsheet featuring 10 different versions of the Bible, where each row is a different verse. You get a free username and password in exchange for registration using an email address.

We can use Pandas to convert the spreadsheet into useful Python data. We then need to pick a Bible to use. I think the most modern translation will probably be best. 


```python
import pandas as pd
```


```python
# Pandas needs the xlrd package to read excel files
!pip3 install xlrd
```

Bibles!

Cool. I think the World English Bible looks good for a modern translation. It does have some annoying "|" we might want to scrub out.


```python
worldbible = df[['Verse', 'World English Bible']]
```


```python
worldbible.head()

So now we D1, a set of tweets, and D2, a set of Bible passages. Let's get matching!

save_data = (D1, D2)
