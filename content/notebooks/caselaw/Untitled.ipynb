The Opponent also argued that in the field of postage meters and electronic computers, the literature to be searched is immensely large and since the features which are looked for are often not mentioned in the abstracts or are not derivable from the drawings, it is extremely difficult to find a relevant document within the opposition period. It was also submitted that the EPO has an obligation to protect the public from invalid patents, and that especially document D7, which is highly relevant to the claimed subject-matter, should be evaluated and introduced into the proceedings.',\n",

Furthermore, he requested that if documents D5 to D7 are admitted, then the case should be remitted to the Opposition Division in order to ensure examination of the main request and the newly filed auxiliary requests by two instances, and that apportionment of costs should be awarded to compensate for the extra costs due to the late filing of such documents.',\n",

Furthermore, if such disclosure is considered in combination with that of one or more of documents D1 to D4, it is possible that a finding of lack of inventive step in respect of subject-matter of Claim 1 as granted might result. For this reason, in the Board's judgment document D7 is sufficiently relevant to be admitted into the opposition proceedings, even though it was filed for the first time during the appeal proceedings.\",\n",

This procedure preserves the possibility of an appeal by either party, depending upon the further decision of the Opposition Division.\",\n",

According to the established jurisprudence of the Boards of Appeal, facts and evidence in support of a Notice of Opposition must be filed as early as possible following the filing of the opposition. The filing of document D7 for the first time during the appeal proceedings, and its subsequent admission into the proceedings, will inevitably increase the costs to be incurred by the patent Proprietor in defending his patent, especially since the case is to be remitted to the Opposition Division, compared to the normal costs which would have been incurred by the patent Proprietor if document D7 had been filed in due time.
